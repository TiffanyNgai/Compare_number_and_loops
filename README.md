# Compare_number_and_loops
SYDE 121 - review activity #3

Assignment instructions:

1) Write a code fragment that will check if an integer target is greater than 5,000, if its third digit from the right is 3, if the second digit from the right is
   even, and if the number is divisible by 10. If the number meets the specified constraints, print “The target is valid \n”.
   You must use a single if statement and a single Boolean variable is_valid for this computation. The target value is hard‐coded within the program
   
2) Write a single for loop that will iterate from [0,10000] inclusive using the entry variable as the iterator and will increment that variable at the step size of
   3. If the entry is divisible by (2 or 3) and 11, then its value is outputted. After five such values are outputted, the loop exits.
   You must use a single integer variable valid_count to keep track of the count of printed valid entries. You should also use a Boolean variable continue_loop to
   help decide if the loop should continue, and another Boolean variable is_valid_entry to check if the current entry is valid.
   Do not use break statements.
   
3) Write a single while or do‐while loop that will require the user to enter a single integer value from [1,10] inclusive. If the entered value is not inside the
   specified range, the entry continues.
   You must use a single integer variable entry to store the results of the user input. You should use a single Boolean variable continue_loop to help decide if the
   loop should continue.
   Do not use break statements.
